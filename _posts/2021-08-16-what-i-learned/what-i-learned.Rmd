## Today in EDS 221: Scientific programming essentials...
### we discussed what it means for data to be "tidy"

I learned that in order for data to be considered tidy, it must satisfy three criteria...
1) Each variable is a column
2) Each observation is a row
3) Each cell contains a single value

### I also gained some data wrangling tools today...
- filter()
- select()
- mutate()
- case_when()
- group_by() %>% summarize()

### I have found that practice and repitition is the best way to really learn to use these tools effectively
